<h3> One of the areas that people who play music often overlook is timing and groove. Just imagine this, 90 percent of the time when you are playing in any kind of musical situation is keeping time and groove for the the singer or the person who is doing the melody, especially if you play instruments such as guitar, bass, piano or the drums, your primary job is to keep the groove in the band to provide a solid back bone and harmony for the singer or the melody
  One good way to train your timing is to use a metronome to practice your rhythm playing. Take a simple groove that you are learning to play or a groove or a rhythmic pattern that you have learned and play it with a metronome. Set the metronome at a slow speed to start with, tap your feet with the metronome so that you can get an inner feel for the pulse of the rhythm. Play to it continuously at that speed and don't change the speed unless you have a good control of the groove at that speed. Increase the speed slightly and repeat the drill until you feel comfortable before you move on to the next speed. Do this consistently during each practice for 15mins to improve your timing and groove. </h3>

    Another aspect and the most important aspect that will take you to a new level in your musicianship is to improve your ears. There are many things you can do to improve your ears. One of things you can do is to transcribe songs. You can take a song that you are familiar with and put the song into a software such as "Transcribe" to slow the song down. I do not suggest that you should transcribe a large chunk of information all at once but instead transcribe a bar or two of information each time.
